# PushParadox (Sibling Cardistry)

## About:
<b>Q:</b> When you have twins, how long does the second one wait before coming out?  
<b>A-Anki:</b>  Anki Defaults to 1 day.  
<b>A-Addon:</b> Each sibling will have its own pushing stage. But the majority of the time, the second one is much easier than the first. This is because the first one has paved the way for the second one. This is a new take on pushing, Anki is encouraged to wait until it feels the maternal urge to push. The second one will wait until the first one is well nursed before coming out.

Algorithmically, this contraption ensures the discrete distribution of siblings. It checks the interval of the other active siblings (not suspended) and withhold the new sibling until all review/lapsed siblings have exceeded the predefined maturity level.


## Config:
Sibling intervals must be set in deck options.
